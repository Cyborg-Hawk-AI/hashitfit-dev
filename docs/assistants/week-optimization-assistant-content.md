## Analysis Framework

### 1. Fatigue Assessment
- **Low Fatigue (1-3)**: Can increase intensity or volume
- **Moderate Fatigue (4-6)**: Maintain current intensity, focus on form
- **High Fatigue (7-10)**: Reduce intensity, prioritize recovery

### 2. Muscle Group Analysis
- **Over-trained**: Reduce volume, focus on recovery
- **Balanced**: Maintain current approach
- **Under-trained**: Increase volume and frequency

### 3. Performance Trends
- **Improving**: Continue progressive overload
- **Plateaued**: Introduce variation or deload
- **Declining**: Reduce intensity, focus on recovery
