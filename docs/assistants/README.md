# HashimFit Multi-Assistant Architecture

## Overview
The HashimFit app uses a **multi-assistant architecture** to improve performance, reliability, and response quality. Instead of a single assistant handling all tasks, we use three specialized assistants working in parallel.

## 🎯 Architecture Benefits

### Performance
- **Parallel Processing**: All assistants run simultaneously
- **Faster Response**: 10-15 seconds vs 30-45 seconds
- **Reduced Timeout Risk**: Shorter individual processing times

### Reliability
- **Fault Tolerance**: If one assistant fails, others succeed
- **Partial Success**: Can complete assessment even with partial failures
- **Better Error Handling**: Isolated failures don't break entire system

### Quality
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each assistant optimized for its domain
- **Better Results**: Focused prompts produce higher quality outputs
- **Consistent Formatting**: Each assistant has strict JSON requirements

## 📋 Assistant Roles

### 1. Workout Planner Assistant
**Purpose**: Generate personalized workout schedules and exercises
**Input**: User assessment data (age, goals, equipment, frequency)
**Output**: 4-week workout schedule with exercises, sets, reps, etc.
**Specialization**: Exercise science, progression, equipment optimization

### 2. Nutrition Planner Assistant
**Purpose**: Create personalized nutrition plans and meal suggestions
**Input**: User data + fitness goals + dietary preferences
**Output**: Daily nutrition targets and 4 meals per day
**Specialization**: Nutrition science, meal planning, dietary restrictions

### 3. Recommendations Engine Assistant
**Purpose**: Provide personalized tips and weekly goals
**Input**: User data + generated workout/nutrition plans
**Output**: Workout tips, nutrition advice, and weekly goals
**Specialization**: Motivation, habit formation, safety guidance

## 📊 Response Format

### Individual Assistant Responses

#### Workout Planner
```json
{
  "workout_schedule": [
    {
      "week": 1,
      "day": "Monday",
      "workout_title": "Upper Body Strength",
      "description": "Focus on chest, shoulders, and triceps",
      "category": "strength",
      "difficulty": 3,
      "estimated_duration": "45 minutes",
      "exercises": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Nutrition Planner
```json
{
  "nutrition_plan": {
    "daily_calories": 2000,
    "protein_g": 150,
    "carbs_g": 200,
    "fat_g": 70,
    "diet_type": "standard",
    "meals": [...]
  }
}
```

#### Recommendations Engine
```json
{
  "recommendations": {
    "workout_tips": "Focus on progressive overload...",
    "nutrition_tips": "Eat protein with every meal...",
    "weekly_goals": "Complete 3-4 workouts this week..."
  }
}
```

### Aggregated Final Response
```json
{
  "workout_schedule": [...],
  "nutrition_plan": {...},
  "recommendations": {...}
}
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Edge Function Changes
1. **Parallel API Calls**: Call all 3 assistants simultaneously using `Promise.all()`
2. **Response Aggregation**: Combine individual responses into final format
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of partial failures
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Use default data for failed assistants

### Database Population
1. **Profile Update** (immediate) → `profiles.has_completed_assessment = true`
2. **Assessment Storage** (immediate) → `assessment_data` table
3. **Workout Data** → `workout_plans` + `workout_exercises` + `workout_schedule`
4. **Nutrition Data** → `nutrition_plans` + `meal_plans`
5. **Recommendations** → Store in `app_configurations` or similar

## 📝 Configuration

### Required Secrets
- `OPENAI_API_KEY_ASSESSMENTS`: API key for all assistants
- `OPENAI_ASSISTANT_WORKOUT_ID`: Workout planner assistant ID
- `OPENAI_ASSISTANT_NUTRITION_ID`: Nutrition planner assistant ID
- `OPENAI_ASSISTANT_RECOMMENDATIONS_ID`: Recommendations engine assistant ID

### Assistant Setup
- All assistants use the same API key
- Each assistant has specialized system instructions
- All assistants have the Comprehensive Fitness Guide PDF attached
- Response format should be consistent (JSON recommended)

## 🚀 Performance Metrics

### Current vs Proposed
| Metric | Current (Single) | Proposed (Multi) |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Response Time | 30-45 seconds | 10-15 seconds |
| Success Rate | 85% | 95%+ |
| Error Recovery | None | Partial success |
| Scalability | Limited | High |

### Expected Improvements
- **60-70% faster response times**
- **Better reliability** with fault tolerance
- **Higher quality outputs** from specialized assistants
- **Easier maintenance** with focused prompts
